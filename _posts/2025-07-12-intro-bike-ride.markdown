title: Intro. My Dream Solo Bike Ride to the Netherlands

Hi, I'm Masha, 26 years old, and recently I decided to chase a dream – to go to the Netherlands by bike!
Biking has always been my go-to activity for calming my mind and organizing my thoughts. Usually it always was just 2-4 hours of bike ride, and then going back home. Yet, ever since I moved to Germany, I had a bigger thought to go to the Netherlands by bike. So I said - I am going no matter what. Without big of the experience in riding a bike, and with extreme big dream and passion of excitment, I ended up riding 1000 km solo all the way from (almost) Leipzig, Germany to the Hague, Netherlands.

My dad found a used bike for me 2 years ago, which I bought for 400 euros. After investing in its maintenance, buying a tent, and having some worried thoughts how it will be riding the whole day, sleeping alone in a tent, and how overall my days will look like, I decided that there is nothing that should hold me back.

### **Simplicity and Clarity of Mind**

To say right away, I didn’t solve any big philosophical questions. Instead, it was more than a week dedicated to truly enjoying the ride, and focusing only on core needs: how to get from point A to an approximate point B (like a campsite), and if you don’t know your point B is closer to the end of the day then it’s mentally more difficult to proceed. 

Overall, it was a week of pure enjoyment, learning to listen to myself, and savoring every moment on the bike while looking forward to reaching my goal.
