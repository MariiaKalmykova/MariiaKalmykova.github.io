Hi, I'm Masha, 26 years old, and recently I decided to chase my big dream ‚Äì to go to the Netherlands by bike!
Biking has always been my go-to activity for calming my mind and organizing my thoughts.
Usually it always was just 2-4 hours of bike ride, and then going back home.
Yet, ever since I moved to Germany, I had a bigger thought to go to the Netherlands by bike.
So I said - I am going no matter what.

Without big of the experience in riding a bike, and with extreme big dream and passion of excitment, I ended up **riding 1000 km solo all the way from (almost) Leipzig, Germany to the Hague, Netherlands.**

My dad found a used bike for me 2 years ago, which I bought for 400 euros. After investing in its maintenance, buying a tent, and having some worried thoughts how it will be riding the whole day, sleeping alone in a tent, and how overall my days will look like, I still decided that there is nothing that should hold me back.

### **Simplicity and Clarity of Mind**

    </p>

To say it right away, I didn't solve any big philosophical questions out there. Instead, it was more than a week dedicated to truly enjoying the ride, being close to nature in all its forms ‚Äì even when it was mostly rain and wind against my direction.
My focus narrowed to just core needs: how to get from point A (starting point) to approximate point B (camping platz).If you don't know your point B as the day gets closer to the end, it's mentally way harder to proceed! Plus, figuring out what to eat for lunch and dinner today, since breakfast was always the same: that "beautiful" oatmeal.

*‚ÄúThe wind goes from West to East‚Äù* that's what one of the granddads in M√ºnster told me. That was one of the only few phrases that really stuck with me and wasn't from my "simplicity and clarity of mind" series. It definitely got harder to ride against the wind as I was coming closer to the sea... Or maybe I just made it up in my head to explain why it was difficult for me to ride.

Overall, it was a week of enjoyment, learning to listen to myself, and savoring every moment on the bike while looking forward to reaching my goal

### **A Journey Home (in Spirit)**

I rarely listened to music while riding, saving it for when I was truly exhausted. One song I particularly love is "Train to Simferopol." Simferopol, my hometown in Crimea, Ukraine, is a place my family and I had to leave in 2014 due to the Russian occupation, when I was 15 years old. Listening to it, I am often overcome with sadness, realizing how long it might be until I could come back home again, or even just visit my homeland.

Yet, seeing so many pensioners on their bikes, cycling for weeks, I found myself wishing, while listening to that song: "I hope that by the time I retire, my home village will be free again and the war will be over. Then, I will ride bikes with my grandchildren from Germany to Crimea, showing them my home."

#### **Call to Support üá∫üá¶**

If you‚Äôd like to support humanitarian aid for Ukraine, you can donate directly via [Paypal link](https://paypal.me/ugloberih?country.x=DE&locale.x=de_D). All donations go to ["Oberih](https://www.facebook.com/share/16kHsAVmcJ/?mibextid=wwXIfr)," a local non-profit community in Leipzig doing incredible work on the ground. Their projects include creating joyful moments for children who lost their parents during the war (like organizing Christmas presents), sending needed equipment to the front lines, and organizing cultural charity events in Leipzig.

No matter where we are, we can all support Ukrainians who are fighting this evil every day, protecting with their lives our freedom to live, enjoy life, and smile.
