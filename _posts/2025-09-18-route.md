title: A route for normal cyclists, with a sense of big adventures.
author: Mariia Kalmykova

On my second night, the coldest one with  +4¬∞C in the night that made me awake at 5am, I stayed in the small village of Seesen. When I arrived at the Camping Platz, I stumbled upon a description of the route I was following that perfectly summed up my experience: **‚ÄúA route for normal cyclists, with a sense of big adventures.‚Äù**

As I mentioned before, the big idea was to ride to the Netherlands. After some research and as said in [my first blogpost](https://mariiakalmykova.github.io/2025/07/12/intro-bike-ride.html) some worried thoughts, my boyfriend and I found  the EuroVelo routes, specifically [EuroVelo 02](<https://en.eurovelo.com/ev2?_gl=1*1wiref7*_gcl_au*Nzk0OTE5NzEzLjE3NTgyMjE3MDg>) (also known as R1) that goes from Warsaw, Poland to London, the UK. Without much overthinking (which is exactly how I like to make decisions), I just went for it from almost Leipzig, Germany to the Hague, Netherlands.

### **But let‚Äôs start from the beginning** ###

- **Preparation.** The route itself was the easy part: Decided and Good to go. My first plan was early May, but it was just too cold. I shifted my vacation to the end of May, hoping for warmth‚Äîit was still cold, but maybe slightly better than the start of the month.

- **Netflix Motivation.** I knew nothing about riding a bike for a whole day, let alone a week, but for some reason, I just decided I could make it. I was also scared to go solo, until I watched a Netflix documentary "Pedal the World" a few days before the trip about a German man who had traveled the world by bike for 50 years. That hit me: **"If he can do that, I can easily handle one week."**

- **The Camping Test.** I was lucky that Rosa, a girl I met randomly at a cafe by a water channel in Leipzig, actually proposed to stay a night with me next to a nearby lake. That night, I understood how unprepared I was for anything camping-related. But I learned fast what do I need to take to the trip:  1. it was so cold to sleep in the night and 2. Rosa supported me with some esssential suggestions.

- **My bike wasn‚Äôt ready.** I also knew almost nothing about fixing a bike. My dad and brother always handled that for me that was always great. But when I started preparing for the trip - my bike wasn't so fit even for city riding. So I had to take action.
I went to local bike workrooms and said to the craftsmen: "I have a big dream to ride to the Netherlands. Can you please check what‚Äôs wrong with my bike and teach me how to fix it?" We changed a lot of details, but honestly, I already slowly forgot what exactly we did. Maybe next time I‚Äôll recall and fix it easily! Many thanks to the local bike workroom and Ben who taught me about bike fixing.

- Also, my friend Matviy was one of the few who supported me going on such a big trip, and he told me to watch a few upskilling videos on bike repair... which, sorry Matviy, I didn't do.

- **Final Packing.** So, I either fixed it myself or mostly asked good people to fix my bike. I bought a simple tent from Decathlon, a thick mattress for sleeping (it was cold at nights), and a few small essentials: snacks, spare tires, and shorts with a cushion (super helpful!). And then I started cycling.

Oh, I was so happy that nothing happened with my bike during the trip and I didn't have to learn those fixing skills on the spot. But hey, I guess any way would have worked out! üôÇ

### **Now let's go back to the route itself** ###

<p style="text-align:center;color:#666;font-size:0.95em;margin-top:0.35em;clear:both;">My route from Aschersleben to the Haague</p>

It was incredible to ride through the whole of Germany. It‚Äôs beautiful, and I was surrounded by really nice and supportive people who wished me luck every single day‚Äîscreaming "Have a good trip!" or "You can do it!" Some even invited me to their houses and dinners, or just kept me company during the riding days (Thank you Benny for such a great day).
Thank you all!

I passed by so many beautiful places: the Harz Forest with its challenging up-and-down roads, rivers, great cities like M√ºnster and Utrecht, and cute old towns and villages (I especially liked the Niedersachsen area, including Goslar and H√∂xter).

Since I ride "medium slow," I could consume thoughtfully all landscapes throughout the day. Being on the bike I was just thinking about what it's like to live there for the locals, and what‚Äôd be like if I live there. And of course, every now and then, I was thinking: "When is the next stop to eat, and what snacks do I have left in my bags?"

While I mostly followed the route, I made a few adjustments:

- I took a train from Leipzig to a nearby town, saved about 1.5 days of cycling and I started directly on the main EuroVelo 02 path.
- Because of the strong wind and the chill I caught from the cold nights cycling in Germany, on my first day in the Netherlands, I decided to adjust a 30 km section. I switched from EuroVelo 2 to a Google Maps-recommended route through the forest. Good decision -  there was no wind in the forest
- My last three days were spent simply cycling around the Netherlands, exploring whatever caught my eye.
