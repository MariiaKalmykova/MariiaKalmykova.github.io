Hi, I'm Masha, 26 years old, and recently I decided to chase a dream – to go to the Netherlands by bike! 
Biking has always been my go-to activity for calming my mind and organizing my thoughts. Usually it always was just 2-4 hours of bike ride, and then going back home. Yet, ever since I moved to Germany, I had a bigger thought to go to the Netherlands by bike. So I said - I am going no matter what. Without big of the experience in riding a bike, and with extreme big dream and passion of excitment, I ended up riding 1000 km solo all the way from (almost) Leipzig, Germany to the Hague, Netherlands. 
My dad found a used bike for me 2 years ago, which I bought for 400 euros. After investing in its maintenance, buying a tent, and having some worried thoughts how it will be riding the whole day, sleeping alone in a tent, and how overall my days will look like, I decided that there is nothing that should hold me back.
